If your Linux laptop's GUI is stuck at the "Opening... Preferred Language: English" screen, try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. _Hard reboot_: Forcefully shut down the laptop by pressing the power button for 10-15 seconds and then restart.

2. _Check boot logs_: Look for errors in the boot logs using `dmesg | grep -i error` or `journalctl -xb` to identify potential issues.

3. _Try a different display manager_: Switch to a different display manager like LightDM or GDM using `sudo apt-get install lightdm` or `sudo apt-get install gdm`.

4. _Reconfigure language settings_: Run `sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales` and `sudo update-locale` to reconfigure language settings.

5. _Disable Wayland_: Try disabling Wayland by editing the `/etc/gdm3/custom.conf` file and uncommenting the line `#WaylandEnable=false`.

6. _Reinstall desktop environment_: Reinstall the desktop environment using `sudo apt-get install --reinstall ubuntu-desktop` (for GNOME) or `sudo apt-get install --reinstall kubuntu-desktop` (for KDE).

7. _Check for updates_: Ensure your system is up-to-date using `sudo apt-get update` and `sudo apt-get upgrade`.

8. _Try a different user account_: Log in with a different user account to isolate the issue.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may want to try booting in recovery mode or seeking further assistance from a Linux community or support forum.
