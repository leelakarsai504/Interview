I am trying to login to azure blob named "pulumi" using pulumi cli in Ubuntu. 
I run command - "pulumi login azblob://pulumi" in Ubuntu but not able to connect. 
It is showing me - "problem logging in: read ".pulumi/meta.yaml": Get "https://analyticscommonpulumi.blob.core.windows.net/pulumi/.pulumi%2Fmeta.yaml": dial tcp 20.150.83.36:443: i/o timeout". 
The same is what my colleague is trying to do but it is working fine for him. 
I have attached the error also. Kindly have a look into it and solve it asap.

Issue in Details   : When I am trying to login to azure blob using pulumi command -> "pulumi login azblob://pulumi", I am able to do so if connected with my phone's hotspot network. But, when I am trying to do the same using office network with/without Netskope ON, I am not able to login or the later command didn't work.
