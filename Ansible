I would like to run specific set of  tasks only on windows vms with example usecase


Here's an example use case:

*Use Case:* Install and configure Microsoft SQL Server on Windows VMs only.

*Ansible Playbook:*
```
---
- name: Install and configure MS SQL Server on Windows VMs
  hosts: all
  gather_facts: yes

  tasks:
  - name: Install MS SQL Server
    block:
      - name: Download MS SQL Server installer
        win_get_url:
          url: (link unavailable)
          dest: C:\Temp\SQLServer2019-SSEI-Dev.exe

      - name: Install MS SQL Server
        win_package:
          path: C:\Temp\SQLServer2019-SSEI-Dev.exe
          product_id: '{4E768E6F-81E5-4CBA-B7E6-6A8D6A8A37A3}'
          state: present
    when: ansible_os_family == "Windows"

  - name: Configure MS SQL Server
    block:
      - name: Enable MS SQL Server service
        win_service:
          name: MSSQLSERVER
          state: started
          enabled: yes

      - name: Set MS SQL Server password
        win_cmd:
          cmd: sqlcmd -S localhost -Q "ALTER LOGIN sa WITH PASSWORD = 'P@ssw0rd';"
    when: ansible_os_family == "Windows"
```
*Explanation:*

1. The playbook targets all hosts (`hosts: all`).
2. Facts are gathered (`gather_facts: yes`) to determine the OS family.
3. The first task block installs MS SQL Server only on Windows VMs (`when: ansible_os_family == "Windows"`).
4. The second task block configures MS SQL Server only on Windows VMs (`when: ansible_os_family == "Windows"`).

*Note:* This is just an example and may require modifications to suit your specific requirements. Additionally, the `win_get_url` and `win_package` modules require the `winrm` connection plugin, which is enabled by default on Windows hosts.
