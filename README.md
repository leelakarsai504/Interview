It sounds like your Ubuntu system is having network connection issues due to a change in the MAC address. Here’s a step-by-step troubleshooting guide to address this problem:

1. Verify the MAC Address Change

	•	Run the following command to check the current MAC address of the interface:

ip link show


	•	Note the MAC address of the network interface. Compare it to the one that was working previously (if known).
	•	If the MAC address is different from what you expect, it may have been changed due to:
	•	Misconfiguration.
	•	A system or driver setting.
	•	A spoofing script or tool.

2. Check Network Interface Configuration

	•	Open the network configuration file:

sudo nano /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml


	•	Ensure the correct MAC address is specified (if needed). For example:

network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    eth0:
      macaddress: xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
      dhcp4: true


	•	Apply the configuration:

sudo netplan apply

3. Detect Systemd or Driver Issues

	•	Check for logs related to the network manager:

sudo journalctl -u NetworkManager


	•	Look for any errors or messages indicating why the MAC address changed.

4. Ensure Consistent MAC Address

	•	If your network interface randomly changes its MAC address, disable MAC address randomization:
	1.	Edit the NetworkManager configuration:

sudo nano /etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf


	2.	Add the following under [device]:

[device]
wifi.scan-rand-mac-address=no


	3.	Restart NetworkManager:

sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager

5. Check for Conflicts

	•	Confirm no other devices are using the same IP or MAC address on the network.
	•	Verify that the DHCP server has assigned a unique IP to your device:

ip a

6. Reset the Network Interface

	•	Restart the network interface:

sudo ifconfig <interface> down
sudo ifconfig <interface> up


	•	Replace <interface> with your actual network interface name (e.g., eth0, wlan0).

7. Update Network Drivers

	•	Ensure the drivers for your network card are up-to-date:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install --reinstall <network-driver>

8. Test the Connection

	•	Ping your gateway or a public IP to confirm connectivity:

ping -c 4 8.8.8.8
ping -c 4 google.com


	•	If 8.8.8.8 works but google.com doesn’t, you have a DNS issue.

9. Reboot the System

	•	Restart the system to ensure all changes take effect:

sudo reboot

If the issue persists, let me know the details of your network interface, MAC address history, and any specific error messages for further assistance.

That's frustrating! Let's troubleshoot the issue step by step.

*Step 1: Check Network Manager Status*

Open a terminal and run the command:
```
sudo service network-manager status
```
This will show you the status of the Network Manager service. If it's not running, you can start it with:
```
sudo service network-manager start
```

*Step 2: Verify MAC Address*

Run the command:
```
ip link show
```
Look for the interface that corresponds to your Ethernet or Wi-Fi adapter (e.g., `eth0`, `wlan0`, etc.). Check if the MAC address is correct. If it's not, you can try to set it manually.

*Step 3: Check Network Configuration*

Run the command:
```
cat /etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/<your_connection_name>
```
Replace `<your_connection_name>` with the actual name of your connection. Look for any issues with the MAC address or other settings.

*Step 4: Restart Network Manager and Check Logs*

Restart the Network Manager service:
```
sudo service network-manager restart
```
Then, check the logs for any errors:
```
sudo journalctl -u NetworkManager
```
Look for any error messages related to the MAC address or connection.

*Step 5: Check for Conflicting MAC Addresses*

Run the command:
```
ip link show | grep -i mac
```
This will show you all the MAC addresses on your system. Check if there are any duplicate or conflicting MAC addresses.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, please provide more details about your setup, such as:

- Ubuntu version
- Network adapter type (Ethernet, Wi-Fi, etc.)
- Connection type (DHCP, static IP, etc.)
- Any recent changes made to your system or network configuration

This will help me provide more specific guidance.
