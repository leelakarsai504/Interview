To troubleshoot internet connectivity issues on your Raspberry Pi running Debian 12, follow these steps:

1. Check Physical Connections
	•	Ensure the Ethernet cable is properly connected if using a wired connection.
	•	Verify the Wi-Fi adapter is plugged in if you’re using Wi-Fi (for older Raspberry Pi models).

2. Check Network Configuration
	•	Run the following commands to check network interfaces:

ip a

Look for eth0 (Ethernet) or wlan0 (Wi-Fi) and verify they have an IP address.

	•	If no IP address is assigned, try restarting the network service:

sudo systemctl restart networking

3. Verify Gateway
	•	Check the default gateway with:

ip route

Ensure there is a route to the gateway. If missing, add it manually (replace 192.168.1.1 with your gateway IP):

sudo ip route add default via 192.168.1.1

4. Test DNS
	•	Test DNS resolution by pinging a domain name:

ping google.com

If this fails, try pinging an IP address like Google’s DNS server:

ping 8.8.8.8

If IP pings work but domain names fail, there’s a DNS issue.

	•	Check the DNS configuration in /etc/resolv.conf:

cat /etc/resolv.conf

Ensure it contains a valid DNS server like:

nameserver 8.8.8.8

5. Verify Wi-Fi (if applicable)
	•	Check if the Wi-Fi interface is active:

sudo iwconfig


	•	Ensure the Wi-Fi network is configured correctly in /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf:

sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf

Add:

network={
    ssid="YourNetworkName"
    psk="YourPassword"
}


	•	Restart the Wi-Fi service:

sudo systemctl restart dhcpcd

6. Check Firewall or Proxy
	•	If you’re behind a corporate network or proxy, ensure the proxy settings are configured.
	•	Check if iptables is blocking traffic:

sudo iptables -L

7. Update System
	•	Ensure your Raspberry Pi is up to date:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

8. Reboot and Test
	•	Reboot the system:

sudo reboot


	•	Test the connection again:

curl -I http://google.com

9. Advanced Troubleshooting
	•	Use dmesg to check for hardware or driver-related errors:

dmesg | grep -i network


	•	Use journalctl for logs:

journalctl -u networking
